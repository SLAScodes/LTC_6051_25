Repository for SLAS's Learn to Code class - Winter 2017, Session 1

Each student either has or will have their own branch on the repository. Find your branch and post your work to it as you progress through the term. You need to check in your work EVERY class session and your work will be evaluated in relationship to the plan and goals you established at the beginning of the term.
